video-files zoom-out is too far. bg borders show up

cleanup check

rebuild video-files questionarie
new reuqest type -> video_mixed - NOPE just modify video_files

- main file - submit / animation type determined automatically at video_gfx
- bg enabled? - thorough question implicating that not having a background file would result in poor graphics unless it's a quality photo of the object
- bg source - file or link. animation type determined automatically at video_gfx / link - always scrolling
- the rest is the same

No round corners at all
