shared parts logic:
    queue manager:
        - operates queue
        - starts operator instances on queue items
        - starts queue item finisher
        - adds db entries
        - switches order status from new to processing
        - switches order status to error, adds error message

    queue item finisher - depr:
        - stores result to storage
        - notifies the customer of the order status

    database handler:
        - stores new order for reference only
        - stores order result for providing output on finish to the customer

    operator:
        - handles the processing screenshot or videoGFX logic
        - returns proprietary objects with the results to the Queue manager

    order status api:
        - checks if order is OK, error, processing from the db
        - returns order details with status, timestamp, error message, output filenames

        - returns files on return
        - deletes files on request
